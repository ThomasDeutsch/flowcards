# flowcards

flowcards is about modular behaviours.<br/>
Enabling "scenario-based programming" for your JS application.

You can compare flowcards to [XState](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate).<br/>
They enable new ways to describe/model reactive systems<br/>
and can serve as a layer above your UI-component structure.
They are like a state-reducer on steroids 💪

## Why flowcards?

finite-state machines and statecharts (XState), provide a way<br/>
for specifying the behavior of the system per object / component.<br/>
For example, take a look at a [traffic-light machine](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate#finite-state-machines).<br>
The behaviour is described in an intra-object (within objects) fashion.

flowcards is not about finite-state machines.
It is based on the idea of describing the behaviour of a system in an inter-object (between objects) way.
This inter-object specification of a system can be achieved by using scenario-based programming.

```

```javascript
import { scenarios, request, wait } from @flowcards/core;

const delayed = (data, ms) => new Promise(r => setTimeout(() => r(data), ms));

function* sender() {
    yield request('event1', 'well done!'); // request an event
    yield request('event2', delayed('you are making progress', 2000)); // async request
}

function* receiver() {
    let message = yield wait('event1'); // wait for event
    console.log(message);
    message = yield wait('event2'); // wait for async event
    console.log(message);
}

scenarios(enable => {
    enable(sender);
    enable(receiver);
});
```
