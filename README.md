# flowcards

using scenarios to enable modular behaviour.

You can compare flowcards to [XState](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate).<br/>
They both enable ways to describe & model reactive systems.<br/>
Use them for well defined state-transitions, and free yourself from switch-case reducers.<br/>

## Comparison

finite-state machines and statecharts (XState), provide a way<br/>
for specifying the behavior of the system per object / component.<br/>
For example, take a look at a [traffic-light machine](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate#finite-state-machines).<br>
The behaviour is described in an intra-object (within object) fashion.

With flowcards, you define behaviours as inter-object flows.<br/>
You know this from UX [user-flows](https://miro.medium.com/max/1548/1*JGL_2ffE9foLaDbjp5g92g.png): A series of steps,<br/>
a user needs to take, to reach a goal.<br/>
Therefore, a system is not defined by the reactivity of each component,<br/>
but by the scenarios / flows you enabled.<br/>

## Quick Start

```
npm install @flowcard/core
```

```javascript
import { scenarios, request, wait } from @flowcards/core;
const delayed = (data, ms) => new Promise(r => setTimeout(() => r(data), ms));

// JS Generators define your scenarios
function* sender() {
    yield request('event1', 'well done!'); // request an event
    yield request('event2', delayed('you are making progress', 2000)); // async request
}

function* receiver() {
    let message = yield wait('event1'); // wait for event
    console.log(message);
    message = yield wait('event2'); // wait for async event
    console.log(message);
}

scenarios(enable => {
    enable(sender);
    enable(receiver);
});
```
