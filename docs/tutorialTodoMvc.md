In this tutorial, we will write a [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) application.<br/>
The goal of this tutorial is to illustrate a key benefit of using flowcards: the ability to translate<br/>
requirements to modular elements in our running software.<br/>

## Begin With the End in Mind
At the end, it comes down to a simple question: Is the software working as desined / expected?<br/>
Answering this question is only possible if you have worked out a design and software requirements.<br/>
<br/>
As a developer, requirements are your friend.<br/>
They enable you to say something like "I have finished my work" or "can you do this task for me?".<br/>
It is nice to have them around.<br/>
