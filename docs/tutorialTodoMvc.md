# Tutorial 1: Requirements -> Code

In this tutorial, we will write a [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) application.<br/>
The goal of this tutorial is to illustrate how flowcards enables a requirement-centric coding style.<br/>
This is the [final result](https://codesandbox.io/s/todomvc-final-xbll0).<br/>

## Begin With the End in Mind

In the end, it comes down to a simple question: Is the software working as desined / expected?<br/>
Answering this question is only possible if you have defined software requirements.<br/>

### A Friend

As a developer, requirements are your friend.<br/>
They enable you to say things like "I have finished my work" or "can you do this task for me?".<br/>
It is nice to have them around.<br/>
We find requirements on both ends - planning and testing - but what about coding?<br/>
They are nowhere to be found in our code.<br/>
We as Developers look at those requirements and use them to make needed changes<br/>
to different parts of our software to fullfill them.<br/>
They shape our code, but the requirement itself is nowhere to be found - they have no place.<br/>
Not a great way to treat your friend.<br/>

### Digging

This becomes a problem when you want to make code-changes.<br/>
You find yourself asking questions like "do we need the property x?" or "why is this if/else here?".<br/>
Requirements would help answer those questions, but they are burried, so you start digging.<br/>

### Experiment

What would happen if requirements have a place in our code?
What would this do to software development, if requirements are found in planning, coding and testing?
We can try this out - right now.

# TodoMVC

The TodoMVC team created [a specification](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/master/app-spec.md#functionality).<br/>
We will use the provided specification for this tutorial.<br/>
I used this [template](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc-app-template/) to create a [basic react application](https://codesandbox.io/s/todomvc-step-1-44z8u) with multiple components and no functionality.<br/>
You do not need to understand react to be able to follow this tutorial.<br/>
I will provide codesandboxes for intermediate steps and link them here. There is no need to type everything in by yourself, but i would encourage you to make small changes and see how they work out.<br/>

## Step 1

Here is the [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/todomvc-step-2-gbj7o) that will include the code from this step.

### NoTodos

The first requirement is simple: When there are no todos, #main and #footer should be hidden.<br/>
This requirement can be translated into this [generator function](https://codeburst.io/understanding-generators-in-es6-javascript-with-examples-6728834016d5):

```ts
function* noTodosWillHideHeaderAndFooter(this: BTContext, itemCount: number) {
  if (itemCount === 0) {
    this.hide("Main", "Footer");
    yield null;
  }
}
```

Every scenario we want to enable will be defined as a generator.<br/>
All you need to know at this point is that a generator will pause its execution when it reaches the yield keyword.
`yield null`means - wait here forever.<br/>
This generator is later used to create something called a BThread.<br/>
<br/>
Let's take a look at the second requirement.

### New Todo

In this requirement we will find a bit more functionality.<br>

- the todoInput gets an autofocus property. ( we do this in html )
- pressing Enter creates a todo (appends it to the todo list)
- an empty input can not be added
- when the todo is added, the input is cleared.

```ts
const handleKeyDown = (onEnter: GuardedDispatch) => (e: any) => {
  if (e.key === "Enter") {
    const dispatch = onEnter(e.target.value);
    if (dispatch) {
      e.target.value = "";
      dispatch();
    }
  }
};

function* newTodoCanBeAdded(this: BTContext, todos: StateRef<Todo[]>) {
  let latestId = 0;
  while (true) {
    this.props("TodoInput", ({ inputOnEnter }) => ({ onKeyDown: handleKeyDown(inputOnEnter) }));
    const val = yield wait("inputOnEnter", (val: string) => val.trim().length > 0);
    yield request("s_todos", [...todos.current, { id: latestId++, title: val, isCompleted: false }]);
  }
}
```

The first thing i want to point out are the variables `latestId` and `inputVal`.<br/>
They are local state. Not local to a component, but local to the scenario.<br/>
`this.override` is a function that will accept a component name and an override expression. This idea comes from the uber-team - called [overrides pattern](https://medium.com/@dschnr/better-reusable-react-components-with-the-overrides-pattern-9eca2339f646). In this case, we change 3 properties of the `TodoInput` component.<br/>
`({inputOnEnter, inputOnChange})`are two dispatch functions. When the input calls them, they will trigger the corresponding events `inputOnEnter` and `inputOnChange`.

The `inputOnEnter` wait function has a second argument. A guard function `(val) => val.trim().length > 0`. If this
guard will return false, the inputOnEnter event can not be dispatched.<br/>
This way, you do not need to make input validation checks in your component. The scenario takes care of it.<br/>

The last thing that happens in this generator is a `request` to change the todos.<br/>
There are only 4 functions you can use: `wait`, `request`, `block` and `intercept`.<br/>
Read more about it [here](https://medium.com/@lmatteis/react-behavioral-cf6523747aaf).<br/>

### Create BThreads

BThreads are created by using the `enable` function.<br/>
The first argument is the genartor-function, the second is an array of arguments for the generator-function. The `state` function is nothing more than an event-cache. It will listen for the `s_totos` event and update itself with the new payload.
Feel free to change the function names to `flow, eventCache` if you like.

```ts
useScenarios((enable, state) => {
  const todosRef = state('s_todos', []);
  enable(noTodosWillHideHeaderAndFooter, [todosRef.current.length]);
  enable(newTodoCanBeAdded, [todosRef]);
});
```

### Apply Overrides

The `useOverrides` hook will take the calculated overrides and apply them to selected Components.<br/>

```ts
const { Main, Footer, TodoInput } = useOverrides(Components, overrides);
```

However, you can use flowcards without overrides if you want.<br/>
The `useScenarios` hook will return a `Scenarios` object, that will contain all the information you need to update your UI.<br/>
<br/>
For example: The todoMVC spec is missing a requirement that todo-items are listed in the main-section.<br/>
If you work directly with the requirements, it is very noticeable.<br/>
You can create a new requirement or you get the state from the `useScenarios` hook and render those Items without a BThread.<br/>

```ts
<Main>
  {state.s_todos.map(todo => (
    <TodoItem title={todo.title} />
  ))}
</Main>
```

## Step 2

Here is the [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/todomvc-step-2-gbj7o) that will include the code from this step.

### TODO

- Zeige die umsetzung des n채chsten Scenarios
- Zeige wie man in der Komponente 체berpr체fen kann, ob eine funktionalit채t vorhanden ist
  -> Dann reicht es einfach Scenarien ein/auszukommentieren.
- Zeige im scaffolden das if (todos.length > 0) ...


## Step 3 - extending behaviours
- block delete and check, as log as there is an item in edit mode.
- props override can be a function
