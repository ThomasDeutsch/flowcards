## Tutorial 1:  Requirements -> Code
In this tutorial, we will write a [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) application.<br/>
The goal of this tutorial is to illustrate how flowcards enables a software-requirement centric coding style.<br/>

### Begin With the End in Mind
In the end, it comes down to a simple question: Is the software working as desined / expected?<br/>
Answering this question is only possible if you have defined software requirements.<br/>

### A Friend
As a developer, requirements are your friend.<br/>
They enable you to say things like "I have finished my work" or "can you do this task for me?".<br/>
It is nice to have them around.<br/>
We find requirements on both ends - planning and testing - but what about coding?<br/>
They are nowhere to be found in our code.<br/>
We as Developers look at those requirements and use them to make needed changes<br/> 
to different parts of our software to fullfill them.<br/>
They shape our code, but the requirement itself is nowhere to be found - they have no place.<br/>
Not a great way to treat your friend.<br/>

### Digging
This becomes a problem when you want to make code-changes.<br/>
You find yourself asking questions like "do we need the property x?" or "why is this if/else here?".<br/>
Requirements would help answer those questions, but they are burried, so you start digging.<br/>

### Experiment
What would happen if requirements have a place in our code?
What would this do to software development, if requirements are found in planning, coding and testing?
We can try this out - right now.

## TodoMVC Requirements
The TodoMVC team [created a specification](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/master/app-spec.md#functionality).
Will skip the fun part of coming up with our own ideas.<br/> 

## 1. Project Setup
The team also provides a [template-project](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc-app-template/).
I used this template project to create a basic React-Application with multiple components and no functionality.
This is the result - lets get to the fun part.

## 2. NoTodos
