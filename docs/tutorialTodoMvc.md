## Tutorial 1:  Requirements -> Code
In this tutorial, we will write a [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) application.<br/>
The goal of this tutorial is to illustrate how flowcards enables a software-requirement centric coding style.<br/>

### Begin With the End in Mind
In the end, it comes down to a simple question: Is the software working as desined / expected?<br/>
Answering this question is only possible if you have defined software requirements.<br/>

### A Friend
As a developer, requirements are your friend.<br/>
They enable you to say things like "I have finished my work" or "can you do this task for me?".<br/>
It is nice to have them around.<br/>
We find requirements on both ends - planning and testing - but what about coding?<br/>
They are nowhere to be found in our code.<br/>
We as Developers look at those requirements, we will understand and use them,<br/>
to make needed changes to different parts of our software.<br/>
They shape our code, but the requirements are nowhere to be found - they are burried.<br/>
Not a great way to treat your friend.<br/>

### Digging
This becomes a problem when you want to make code-changes.<br/>
You find yourself asking questions like "do we need the property x?" or "why is this if/else here?".<br/>
Requirements would help answer those questions, but they are burried, so you start digging.<br/>

### Experiment
What would happen if requirements are not abandoned?
What would this mean for developing software when requirements play a central role in planning, coding and testing?
We can will this out - right now.
