In this tutorial, we will write a [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) application.<br/>
The goal of this tutorial is to illustrate how flowcards enables a software-requirement centric coding style.<br/>

## Begin With the End in Mind
At the end, it comes down to a simple question: Is the software working as desined / expected?<br/>
Answering this question is only possible if you have worked out a design and software requirements.<br/>

## A Friend
As a developer, requirements are your friend.<br/>
They enable you to say things like "I have finished my work" or "can you do this task for me?".<br/>
It is nice to have them around.<br/>
We find requirements on both ends - planning and testing - but what about coding?<br/>
They are nowhere to be found in our code.<br/>
We as Developers look at the requirements, we will understand them to the best ouf our abilities and use them<br/>
to make the needed changes to different parts of our software.<br/>
They shape our code, but the requirement itself is nowhere to be found - they are burried.<br/>
Not a great way to treat your friend.<br/>

## Digging
This becomes a problem when you want to make code-changes.<br/>
You find yourself asking questions like "do we need the property x?" or "why is this if/else here?".<br/>
Requirements would help to answer those questions, but they are burried.<br/>
So you start digging.<br/>
