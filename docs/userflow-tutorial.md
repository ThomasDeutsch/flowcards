A conversation between the RE-Team and developers.
We are building a simple app, wehere people are able to sign on to different newsletters.
We provide a list of recommended reads, get some additional info and can then proceed to subscribe.

- user can purchase a selected product an will get a confirm message
- the user needs to fill out a form with all necessary details for the purchase
	- the user needs to accept the t&c before he can purchase the product

then change the event to an async event by adding apromise to the purchase event.

- the user can select a product from a list of items
- the user will return to the list of producs after the confim-message is shown for 3 seconds.
