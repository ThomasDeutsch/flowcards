# effective teams: user-flow and code

In this tutorial we will discover how a team of UX-Designers and Frontend-Developers<br/> 
can work hand in hand, to create a frontend application.<br/>
This is done by using the same "language" for both disciplines.<br/>
UX and DEV will describe the software as a combination of multiple user-flows (scenarios).<br/>
During this tutorial, you will learn the basic building blocks of SBP.

## the task
The team wants to build a simple app where people can buy produce from a local farm.<br/>
From tomatoes to potatoes ... everything that the local farm has to offer.<br/>
After the first meetings, everone is on board and the team created a first vision for the app.<br/>
The first requirements and ideas were gathered and the UX-Team created a first user-flows.<br/>

## no handoff
Instead of presenting the developers a complete vision in form of a developer-handoff, the team<br/>
wants to do things differently.<br/>
Work is not thrown over the fence. Developers and Designers will use the created user-flows as the center.<br/>

## first flow
user-flows are not only a form of specification, they are a great way communicate ideas.<br/>
The UX-team made a great effort to create the first user-flow for discussions.

## first feedback
