# from user-flow to code

In this tutorial we will discover how a team of UX-Designers and JavaScript-Developers<br/> 
can work hand in hand, to create a frontend application.<br/>
This is done by using the same "language" for both disciplines.<br/>
UX and DEV will describe the software as a combination of multiple user-flows (scenarios).<br/>
During this tutorial, you will learn the basic building blocks of SBP.

## the task

From tomatoes to potatoes ... everything that the local farm has to offer.<br/>
After the first meetings, everone is on board and the team created a first vision for the app.<br/>
The first requirements and ideas were gathered and the UX-Team created a first user-flows.<br/>
